The structure of a JS change object is the same as that of the JS state object, except that a JS object of an object group does not have/is not supposed to have a ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"list")," field \u2013 that is, all changes are supposed to be made for current object collection. However, if necessary, the ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"value")," can be set to a single-element array, which will mean that there is no need to change the current object, but property values should be changed for the specified, not the current object. For example, ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"change(setState, {game:{value:[30], hostGoals:40, guestGoals:30}})")," will change the number of goals to ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"40")," and ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"30"),", but not for the current game, but for one with an object id ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"30"),". You can also specify actions in a JS change object (there are no actions in JS state objects). The value of the corresponding field in this case can be arbitrary. For example, ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"change(setState, {game: {doSmthWithGame : true}})")),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"currentState")," - a JS object of the current state. Optional parameter. In order to ensure the best UX in the asynchronous mode, it is advised that the user change values only for the objects that he sees during the change and not when the change is processed (the state can change at this moment and so can current objects). Therefore, when calling this function, it is recommended to pass the state that was used to render the view in which the user initiated this change as the ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"currentState")," parameter."))),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"close")," - closes the form.
